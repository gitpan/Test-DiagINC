NAME
    Test::DiagINC - List all modules and versions loaded if tests fail

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        # Load *BEFORE* Test::More
        use if $ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}, 'Test::DiagINC';
        use Test::More;

DESCRIPTION
    Assuming you shipped your module to CPAN with working tests, test
    failures from CPAN Testers <http://www.cpantesters.org/> might be due to
    platform issues, Perl version issues or problems with dependencies. This
    module helps you diagnose deep dependency problems by showing you
    exactly what modules and versions were loaded during a test run.

    When this module is loaded, it sets up an "END" block that will take
    action if a program exits with a non-zero exit code. If that happens,
    this module prints out the names and version numbers of all modules
    appearing in %INC at the end of the test.

    For example:

        $ perl -MTest::DiagINC -MTest::More -e 'fail("meh"); done_testing'
        not ok 1 - meh
        #   Failed test 'meh'
        #   at -e line 1.
        1..1
        # Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.
        # Listing modules and versions from %INC
        #   5.018002 Config
        #       5.68 Exporter
        #       5.68 Exporter::Heavy
        #       1.07 PerlIO
        #   1.001002 Test::Builder
        #   1.001002 Test::Builder::Module
        #      0.001 Test::DiagINC
        #   1.001002 Test::More
        #       1.22 overload
        #       0.02 overloading
        #       1.07 strict
        #       1.03 vars
        #       1.18 warnings
        #       1.02 warnings::register

    NOTE: Because this module uses an "END" block, it must be loaded before
    "Test::More" so that the "Test::More"'s "END" block has a chance to set
    the exit code first. If you're not using "Test::More", then it's up to
    you to ensure your code generates the non-zero exit code (e.g. "die()"
    or exit(1)).

    If "Test::More" is loaded, the output will go via the "diag" function.
    Otherwise, it will just be sent to STDERR.
